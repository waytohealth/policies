# 10. Facility Access Policy

W2H works with Subcontractors to assure restriction of physical access to systems used as part of the W2H Platform. W2H and its Subcontractors control access to the physical buildings/facilities that house these systems/applications, or in which W2H workforce members operate, in accordance to the HIPAA Security Rule 164.310 and its implementation specifications. Physical Access to all of W2H facilities is limited to only those authorized in this policy. In an effort to safeguard ePHi from unauthorized access, tampering, and theft, access is allowed to areas only to those persons authorized to be in them and with escorts for unauthorized persons. All workforce members are responsible for reporting an incident of unauthorized visitor and/or unauthorized access to W2H's facility.

Of note, W2H does not physically house any systems used by its Platform in W2H facilities. Physical security of our Platform servers is outlined [in ยง1.1 - W2H Organizational Concepts](./01-introduction.md#11-w2h-organizational-concepts).
