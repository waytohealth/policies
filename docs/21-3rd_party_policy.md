1. W2H does not allow 3rd party access to production systems containing ePHI.
2. All connections and data in transit between the W2H Platform and 3rd parties are encrypted end to end.
3. A standard business associate agreement with Customers and Partners is defined and includes the required security controls in accordance with the organization's security policies. Additionally, responsibility is assigned in these agreements.
4. W2H has Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with Subcontractors with an agreed service arrangement addressing liability, service definitions, security controls, and aspects of services management.
   * Subcontractors must coordinate, manage, and communicate any changes to services provided to W2H.
   * Changes to 3rd party services are classified as configuration management changes and thus are subject to the policies and procedures described in [ยง9](./09-configuration_management_policy.md); substantial changes to services provided by 3rd parties will invoke a Risk Assessment as described in [ยง4.2](./04-risk_management_policy.md#42-risk-management-policies).
5. No W2H Customers or Partners have access outside of their own environment, meaning they cannot access, modify, or delete anything related to other 3rd parties.

7. W2H maintains and annually reviews a list all current Partners and Subcontractors.
   * The list of current Partners and Subcontractors is maintained by the W2H Privacy Officer, includes details on all provided services (along with contact information), and is recorded in [ยง1.1](./01-introduction.md#11-w2h-organizational-concepts).
   * The annual review of Partners and Subcontractors is conducted as a part of the security, compliance, and SLA review referenced below.
8. W2H assesses security, compliance, and SLA requirements and considerations with all Partners and Subcontractors. This includes annual assessment of SOC2 reports for all W2H infrastructure partners.
9. Regular review is conducted as required by SLAs to assure security and compliance. These reviews include reports, audit trails, security events, operational issues, failures and disruptions, and identified issues are investigated and resolved in a reasonable and timely manner.
10. Any changes to Partner and Subcontractor services and systems are reviewed before implementation.
11. For all partners, W2H reviews activity to assure partners are in line with SLAs in contracts with W2H.
12. SLA review is monitored on an exception basis.

14. Changes to the 3rd Party Assurance process will also be made on an ad-hoc basis in cases where operational changes require it or if the process is found lacking.
